                    <h2>Who's Itachi Uchiha </h2>
                    <p>
                        Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. 
                        He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, 
                        sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international 
                        criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent 
                        conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their 
                        clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be 
                        more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest 
                        of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very
                        end.

                    <h2>Background </h2>
                    <p>
                        Itachi shared the burden of betraying his clan with Shisui. But as time went on it became 
                        increasingly clear that peace could not be achieved. Shisui intended to use his Kotoamatsukami on 
                        the Uchiha's leaders to compel them to negotiate, but his right eye was stolen by Danzō before he 
                        had a chance. His own options exhausted, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi and begged him 
                        to protect the village and their family name before drowning himself in the Naka River. Itachi was 
                        anguished by Shisui's death, awakening his Mangekyō Sharingan. The following day some Uchiha, already 
                        suspicious of Itachi, accused him of murdering Shisui and staging a suicide; Itachi lost his composure 
                        and attacked them, defeating them easily. A rift was created between Itachi and his family, and his 
                        warnings to them to reconsider what they were doing fell on deaf ears. At age 12, he was promoted to Anbu 
                        Captain, with his publicly disclosed promotion age being 13 due to Danzō's request and Hiruzen's 
                        acceptance. In the anime, Itachi was also given command of his own three-man squad. Itachi 
                        would confront his father in the Naka Shrine basement, who revealed that he had awoken his own Mangekyō 
                        Sharingan during the Third Shinobi World War. Having read the Stone Tablet and learned the truth of the 
                        Mangekyō Sharingan's power, Fugaku calls for Itachi's aid in a bloodless revolution restraining the 
                        higher-ups, in lieu of controlling the Nine-Tailed Fox, resisting the clan's favour of bloodshed. 
                        Instead, Itachi would return back to the Konoha Council to report the clan's imminent revolt.

                    <h2>Personality </h2>
                    <p>
                        From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge
                        on how to deal with every situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather
                        humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor underestimating others, most things he said 
                        would be unbiased and accurate. If an opponent exceeded his expectations or posed a legitimate challenge 
                        to him or his allies, Itachi would freely admit it. As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par 
                        with a Hokage. Having studied history, not just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained 
                        a broader appreciation of what was important. Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of 
                        the past came to happen and, when he applied that same understanding into the future, he became concerned
                        for where things were going. At the same time, Itachi was still fairly naïve as a child in many 
                        real-world scenarios and as such was willing to learn from his peers on how to differentiate situations.
                        [15] He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so that 
                        he could fully understand them.

                    <h2>Appearance </h2>
                    <p>
                        Itachi was a fairly tall man of fair complexion. He had black eyes, under which were long, pronounced 
                        tear-troughs. He had jet-black hair that was pulled back in a low ponytail and his face was framed with 
                        centre-parted bangs that extended to his chin; the ponytail and bangs grew longer over the years. His overall 
                        appearance was very similar to Sasuke's.[52][53] Even more, like his brother, he was considered very handsome 
                        as many girls became infatuated with him.[9] When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes consisted of a 
                        black shirt with the Uchiha clan symbol on the back, bandages around his ankles, and black sandals. He wore 
                        tan pants with a weapons pouch strapped to his back. When on duty, he would wear the standard Anbu uniform 
                        complete with arm guards, a flak jacket, and a porcelain mask which was fashioned to resemble a weasel with 
                        a red, triangular marking on top.[54]

                    <h2>Abilities  </h2>
                    <p>
                        Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent, never before seen in the
                        history of the academy.[55] Well-known for consistently showing prowess far beyond his years, he quickly rose 
                        through the ranks to become one of the strongest shinobi Konoha ever produced. Itachi had the fastest time 
                        for completing the Forest of Death in his Chūnin Exams, in 5 hours and 37 minutes, while 9 years old and 
                        competing solo.[16] Despite his still young age, he was highly proficient in all three main ninja skill sets, 
                        effortlessly learning new techniques from simple observation, and gained praise from allies and foes alike; 
                        Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly admitted Itachi was stronger than him,[56] and Shisui, well-regarded as 
                        the strongest Uchiha of their time, viewed Itachi as stronger.[57] Despite being weakened from illness, while 
                        Sasuke had trained under and absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their final 
                        battle if he wanted to.[58] Even when restraining himself, Itachi still pushed a 3-man team of elite jōnin to 
                        their limits.[23]
